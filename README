1. What is WTP?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	WTP is a webbased FTP client written in PHP. It allows you to access FTP
	sites through a kind of web-proxy. The client (your browser) connects to 
	a webserver and the webserver connects to the FTP server.
    
	WTP is a very thin client. It doesn't handle all types of FTP servers and
	doesn't implement a full FTP feature-set. It is merely meant as an easy
	user friendly way for people to access, manage, download and upload files 
	from a particular site.

2. Requirements.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	WTP requires:
		* PHP 4.1+ with FTP functions enabled.
		* For downloads to work: A FTP server which supports Passive FTP.

	WTP was developed for the following programs, and may therefor not work
	on any or all other services:
		* PHP 4.1.2
		* Mozilla / Galeon
		* ProFTP 1.2.0pre10
	
	It is confirmed that WTP also works with the following:
		* ProFTP 1.2.0pre10
		* NetKit FTP server 0.17-14 (Debian GNU/Linux Woody)
		* MicroBSD FTP server v6.5 (MicroBSD)
		* Pure-FTPd 1.0.16 (on OpenBSD 3.4)
		* WarFTPd (win32) 1.70/1.80

		(If you can confirm that WTP also works on other configurations, 
		please let me know by emailing me about it)


3. Installation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	If you are upgrading from a previous version of WTP, please read through 
	the UPGRADING file, for	information on significant changes in the latest
	releases of WTP which might break the installation or user's files.

	Automatic:
	
		Since version 0.4.0, WTP's default preferences directory has changed
		from /usr/local/wtp to /var/wtp. Please take it in consideration.
		
		1. Run setup.sh (at the commandprompt type: ./setup.sh)
		2. You may want to modify your PHP's configuration options to allow larger
		   HTTP-post file uploads. You can do this by modifying the following 
		   options in your php.ini file:
		   upload_max_filesize = 20M
		   post_max_size  = 20M
		3. Internet Explorer suffers from a bug which causes downloads through
		   SSL to fail. Adding this to your apache-ssl configuration might
		   fix it:

		   BrowserMatch ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

		   For Debian, it should be added to the srm.conf file.

		   This is not a sure fix. It has been known to work for some people,
		   and fail for some others. This is a Internet Explorer bug, 
		   and can't be helped unless Microsoft clean's up and starts
		   adhering to the basic rules of 'standards' instead of doing
		   everything their own way (and not documenting them).
		4. Some configurations of PHP have open_basedir set. This will interfer 
		   with WTP's ability to save bookmarks. You should include the preference
		   directory which you specified during install to the open_basedir 
		   directive.
		   
	Manually:

		Since version 0.4.0, WTP's default preferences directory has changed
		from /usr/local/wtp to /var/wtp. Please take it in consideration.
		
		1. Copy the wtp.php file somewhere in your webserver's accessible path.
		2. Copy the images/ dir to the same dir as wtp.php
		3. Edit the wtp file and change any variables in the CHANGE THESE VARS 
		   section.
		4. You may want to modify your PHP's configuration options to allow larger
		   HTTP-post file uploads. You can do this by modifying the following 
		   options in your php.ini file:
		   upload_max_filesize = 20M
		   post_max_size  = 20M
		5. Internet Explorer suffers from a bug which causes downloads through
		   SSL to fail. Adding this to your apache-ssl configuration will 
		   fix it:

		   BrowserMatch ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

		   For Debian, it should be added to the srm.conf file.
		6. Some configurations of PHP have open_basedir set. This will interfer 
		   with WTP's ability to save bookmarks. You should include the preference
		   directory which you specified during install to the open_basedir 
		   directive.
