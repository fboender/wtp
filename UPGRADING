Upgrading WTP.

This file is here so you will know what to look for if you are upgrading from
a previous version of WTP. Please read this file carefully, and follow all
steps from the sections, starting with the one which follows the release version
you are currently using.


v0.5.0
------
In this version, the bookmarks file in the preferences directory have changed.
WTP used to separate the username and hostname by using a '-', which is wrong,
since these might also be used in domainnames. Therefor the new separator is
' ' (space), and all bookmark files (hostname.tld-username) need to be renamed 
(hostname.tld username). This will have to be done by hand (sorry), using the
'mv' command:

[root@sharky]/var/wtp/# mv nihilist.nl-todsah nihilist.nl\ todsah
[root@sharky]/var/wtp/# mv this-host.nihilist.nl-todsah this-host.nihilist.nl\ todsah


The default preferences directory has also changed from /usr/local/wtp/ to 
/var/wtp. You will have to move the bookmark files in the old path to the 
new path, after running the install script, or you may simply specify the old
directory as the preferences path.
